# funWithInterfaces

Object Orientated Web/API routing system built with PHP7 

This is the skeleton for a routing system and an example of coding to interfaces.  There is no content but this structure can be ported and implemented by simply adding your own controllers.  This example does not have a check login function or any real implementation of security features (as this I use this structure in my live projects) - however I would encourge you to add in your own interfaces for authentication! 

With this bare bones you will be able to navigate between the existing controllers.
